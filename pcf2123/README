This is an Arduino IDE compatible SPI driver for the NXP Semiconductors
PCF2123 real-time clock.

PCF2123 is an "ultra" low-power (sub-uA) RTC that supports a number of alarm
features, as well as square wave clock signal output.

It uses the LGPL-licensed Time library: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time

This library provides access to nearly all of the RTC's features. Datasheet:

If you are planning to call PCF2123 from an interrupt handler, remember to
register your interrupt with SPI.usingInterrupt().
